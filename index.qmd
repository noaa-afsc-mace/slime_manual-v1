This is the **Slime Lab Manual**. This manual describes the procedures for at sea data biological sampling and physical oceanographic measurements that occur aboard the NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson during a NOAA-AFSC Midwater Assessment Conservation Engineering (MACE) survey. The manual is written to provide an overview of the sampling procedures that take place in the chem/fish lab for new or volunteer scientists/staff, a place for returning scientist to refresh themselves on procedures, and in-depth guide for all tasks that occur in the slime lab.

This manual is broken into several sections, [Pre-Season Preparations](pre-season_preparation.qmd), [Gear Trials](gear_trials.qmd), [Acoustic Calibration](calibration.qmd), [Pre-Haul Preparations](pre-haul_preparations), [Sampling Procedures](sampling_procedures), [Data QA/QC](data_verification_clams.qmd), and [Post Survey Tasks](post-survey.qmd). Some [Additional References](references.qmd) are also provided. There is a sidebar on the left to navigate to main topics. Within each topic there is a Table of Contents on the right side of the screen that can be used to navigate to content within that topic.
