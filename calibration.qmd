# Acoustic Calibration

Fish lab personnel assist with acoustic calibration. If the vessel's large CTD is not working or if staff is not available the CastAway-CTD (aka "football") can be used. This piece of equipment is stored in the Chem Lab.

**More Info Needed:** I am thinking some instructions on the calibration spheres and downriggers would be nice.

## CastAway-CTD
For select purposes the CastAway-CTD can be used as alternative to the large CTDs. The larger CTD may require 3-4 ship crew to safely cast over the “Hero deck” (side sampling station) while the small football CTD only requires 1 individual. To cast the CastAway-CTD secure it to the railing on the “Hero deck” and lower down to 30m. Communicate with the Bridge before and after lowering anything into the water from the ship.

1.	If not installed, insert  two of the rechargeable AA batteries included in the CastAway case into the CT
a.	Remove the rubber outer case and unscrew bottom end cap to insert batteries, then reinsert CTD into rubber outer case
2.	Using the magnetic stylus, turn on the CTD by inserting the magnetic end of the stylus into the contact on the top left of the screen.
3.	Using the contact on the bottom left to move the selection (white box), make sure the deployment symbol , the small image of the CTD, is selected.
4.	To start the cast, touch the contact on the bottom right with the magnetic stylus. The CTD will report if it is still waiting for GPS signal which is required for the date /time.
5.	After the cast is complete, touch the contact on the bottom right again to end the recording.
