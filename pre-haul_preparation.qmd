# Pre-Haul Preparation

It is the responsibility of the Chief Scientist or their designee to determine the areas/depths where trawl hauls will be made. Decisions will be based on a semi-systematic, opportunistic sampling scheme to maximize the value of each sample with respect to the objectives of the survey. Once the timing of sampling has been determined there are several items that can be prepared in the fish lab. 

## SBE
When “Fishing, Fishing, Fishing” has been called and/or the net is being setup on deck, initiate the SBE at least 15 minutes prior to fishing (see section IV.A. - SBE 39 Temperature/Pressure data recorder instructions). Your presence may be requested on the bridge for the 15 minute whale watch, so do this before you head up to the bridge.


## CamTrawl
Ensure a charged CamTrawl battery is placed in the CamTrawl, connected, closed, and secured with “spaghetti” locking cord. Verify that the green light is slowly blinking on the dummy plug before deck crew attaches the assembly to the net. Floats should be upright or to the port side if laying down on top of the net The deck crew is responsible for securing the CamTrawl to the net.
See G:\Book of the CAVE and SOPs\BOC\BOC Associated Documents\CamTrawl for the latest CamTrawl quick guide.

## Marel Scales
The large basket scale (at the end of the conveyor belt) and the smaller specimen scales (on the counters) require calibration before each haul is processed - use the stainless steel 20 kg (large scale) and 2 kg (small scale) weights provided for this purpose for each scale respectively. Remove all objects from scale and dump any water collected on top the 20 kg weight. 

**Marel M1100 Calibration:**

1. Simultaneously press the MENU and ZERO keys:

  * Wait until the scale asks for a reference weight – May take 15 seconds. “Put 20” or “Put 2” will display.

2. Place the reference weight (i.e. 20 or 2 kg weight) on the platform then press the PRINT key:

  * The message “===” appears on the display while the calibration takes place.
  * When the calibration is complete, the message “Fit nn” appears.
  *	Values above 25 indicate a poor calibration; repeat calibration if needed.

**Notes:**

* While using the scale, Grade should be selected not Packing. Use the up or down arrow to change. The scale will not input weight into Clams when in Packing mode.
* Place an empty basket or tub on the scale and press “Tare”. You are ready to weigh baskets!
* If the scale is not steady and it has become more difficult to collect weights it may be necessary to recalibrate scales particularly if weather changes or the ride of the ship changes between the initial calibration and getting back on transect.


## Other Items
Replace and refill standard sampling supplies such as scalpel blades, the glycerol thymol squeeze bottle, vials caps, and the otolith vials trays as needed.

Determine if special study requests are applicable for the region and haul type and prepare for sampling if necessary (i.e., set up supplies, prepare labels, ovary bags, storage bags).

## Protected Species Watch (AKA Whale Watch)
Check in the with FPC or Cave Lead to determine if you are requested to complete a whale watch on the bridge 15 minutes prior to the net entering the water. Updated protocols for protected species observation and avoidance measures is located in the “BOC Associated Documents” folder or the current cruise folder. For 2025, look for the document titled “MACE protected species at-sea procs_FY25_v11.docx”. When beginning whale watch a common practice is to check in with the Officer on Deck (OOD) and ask if they have seen any protected species near the fishing location and what direction the ship will be heading for fishing, therefore to focus observation in that direction.
